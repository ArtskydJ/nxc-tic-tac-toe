nxc-tic-tac-toe
===============

The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, now on your NXT!

Compile with the NXC compiler.

I don't believe this requires the enchanced NBC/NXC firmware.

#Known Issues

- The AI moves randomly, unless it is able to win, in which case, it wins

#To Do

- Change the coding style. I wrote it over 2 years ago and it looks ugly now. :)
